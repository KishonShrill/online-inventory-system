# CDIIS Online Inventory System

## Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **CDIIS Online Inventory System**! This project aims to develop a robust and user-friendly web-based platform for managing inventory efficiently. The system will provide tools for tracking and managing equipment information and handling incoming and outgoing items.

## Project Status

This repository is currently in its **initial commit phase**. There's no functional code or system implemented yet. This README serves as a foundational document for the project's vision, goals, and planned development.

## Vision

Our vision is to create a reliable and intuitive inventory management solution that streamlines operations, reduces manual errors, and provides real-time insights into inventory status for businesses or organizations of all sizes.

## Key Features (Planned)

While still in the planning stages, the CDIIS Online Inventory System is envisioned to include the following core functionalities:

- [*] **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure login and role-based access control.
- [ ] **Product Management:** Add, edit, delete, and view product details (SKU, name, description, price, etc.).
- [ ] **Inbound/Outbound Transactions:** Record and manage incoming (e.g., borrowers) and outgoing (e.g., lenders) inventory movements.
- [ ] **Search & Filtering:** Efficiently search and filter inventory data.
- [ ] **Dashboard:** An overview of key inventory metrics.

* **Backend:** Node.js (Express)
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **Deployment:** Vercel
